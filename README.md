# Customer-Segmentation-for-Retail-Business
Project Overview
This project focuses on customer segmentation for a retail business using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and K-Means clustering. The goal is to identify different customer segments, understand their purchasing behaviors, and derive actionable insights for marketing and business strategy.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of transactional data from a retail business, including the following fields:

InvoiceNo: Unique invoice number
StockCode: Unique code for each product
Description: Product description
Quantity: Number of products purchased
InvoiceDate: Date and time of the transaction
UnitPrice: Price per unit of the product
CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer
Country: Country where the transaction took place
Project Structure
Data Preprocessing: Loaded and cleaned the dataset, handled missing values, and created a TotalPrice column to represent the total revenue generated per transaction.

RFM Calculation: Computed Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values for each customer to quantify their purchasing behavior.

Customer Segmentation: Used K-Means clustering to segment customers based on RFM values.

Visualization: Created various plots to visualize the distribution of RFM metrics across clusters and understand customer behavior within each segment.

High-Value Customer Analysis: Identified and analyzed the segment of high-value customers to inform marketing strategies.

Installation and Setup
To run this project locally, follow the steps below:

Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Install Required Libraries:
Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required libraries using pip:

Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn openpyxl
Download the Dataset:
Place your dataset (Online-Data.xlsx) in the project directory.

Run the Analysis:
Execute the Python script to perform customer segmentation:

Copy code
python customer_segmentation.py
Visualizations
The project includes the following visualizations:

Elbow Method Plot: Used to determine the optimal number of clusters for K-Means.
RFM Boxplots: Visualize the distribution of Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values across different clusters.
Cluster Heatmap: Shows the average RFM metrics for each cluster.
Customer Journey Analysis (Optional): Tracks changes in customer recency over time (if applicable).
Results and Insights
Customer Segments: The analysis identifies several distinct customer segments, such as high-value customers, frequent buyers, and customers who have not purchased recently.
Business Strategy: The results can be used to create targeted marketing campaigns, improve customer retention, and optimize resource allocation.
Future Enhancements
Possible extensions to the project include:

Incorporating additional customer data (e.g., demographics) for more granular segmentation.
Analyzing customer lifetime value (CLTV) and predicting future purchasing behavior.
Implementing automated alerts for at-risk customers based on their RFM scores.
